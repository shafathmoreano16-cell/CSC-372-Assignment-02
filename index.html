                                    <p>The best time to visit these restaurants is during lunch or dinner hours, as they can get busy during peak times. It's always a good idea to check the restaurant's website or call ahead to confirm their hours of operation and make a reservation if necessary. Additionally, many of these restaurants offer takeout and delivery options, so you can enjoy their delicious food from the comfort of your dorm or apartment.</p> 
                                    <p>Restaurant 2 is my favorite one because you are able to get all kind of different food in the same restaurant.</p>
